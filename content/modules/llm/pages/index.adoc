= Generative AI {deliverable} with {productname-long}
:!sectids:

== Introduction

Now that you've learned the basics of {productname-long} using a Predictive AI model, it's time to explore Generative AI. Generative AI is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses machine learning to generate new data. It's used in a variety of applications, including image generation, text generation, and music generation.

In this {deliverable}, we'll explore using a large language model (LLM) downloaded from Huggingface.  We'll be using This is a small LLM we can use with minimal resources.

You'll use an example fraud detection model to complete the following tasks:

* Explore a pre-trained fraud detection model by using Jupyter Notebooks.
* Deploy the model by using {productname-short} model serving.
* Refine and train the model by using automated pipelines.

And you'll do all of this without having to install anything on your own computer, thanks to https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/openshift-data-science[{productname-long}].

== About the example fraud detection model

The example fraud detection model mentors credit card transactions for potential fraudulent activity. It analyzes the following credit card transaction details:

* The geographical distance from the previous credit card transaction.
* The price of the current transaction, compared to the median price of all the userâ€™s transactions.
* Whether the user completed the transaction by using the hardware chip in the credit card,  entered a PIN number, or for an online purchase.

Based on this data, the model outputs the likelihood of the transaction being fraudulent.
