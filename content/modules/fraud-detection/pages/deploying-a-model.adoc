= Deploying a data model

Now that the model is accessible in storage and saved in the portable ONNX format, you can use an {productname-short} model server to deploy it as an API.

{productname-short} multi-model servers can host several models at once. You create a new model server and deploy your model to it.

=== Procedure

. In the {productname-short} dashboard, navigate to *Models and model servers*.

. Under *Single model serving platform*, click *Deploy model*.

. In the form:

.. Fill out the *Model Name* with the value `fraud`.
.. Select the *Serving runtime*, `OpenVINO Model Server`.
.. Select the *Model framework*, `onnx - 1`.
.. Set the *Model server replicas* to `1`).
.. Select the *Compute resources per replica*, `Small`.
.. Select the *Existing data connection*: `My Storage`
.. Enter the path to your uploaded model: `models/fraud`
